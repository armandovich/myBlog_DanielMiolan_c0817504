                        Android software development is the process by which applications are created for devices running the Android operating system. Google states that 
                        "Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages" using the Android software development kit (SDK), while using other languages is 
                        also possible. All non-Java virtual machine (JVM) languages, such as Go, JavaScript, C, C++ or assembly, need the help of JVM language code, that may 
                        be supplied by tools, likely with restricted API support. Some programming languages and tools allow cross-platform app support. 
                        Third party tools, development environments, and language support have also continued to evolve and expand since the initial SDK was released in 2008. 
                        The official Android app distribution mechanism to end users is Google Play; it also allows staged gradual app release, as well as distribution of 
                        pre-release app versions to testers.
                    </p>

                        The Android software development kit (SDK) includes a comprehensive set of development tools. The Android SDK Platform Tools are a separately downloadable 
                        subset of the full SDK, consisting of command-line tools such as adb and fastboot. The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a tool to run commands on a connected 
                        Android device. Fastboot is a protocol used for flashing filesystems. Code written in C/C++ can be compiled to ARM, or x86 native code 
                        (or their 64-bit variants) using the Android Native Development Kit (NDK).

                        The Android Developer Challenge was a competition to find the most innovative application for Android. Google offered prizes totaling 10 million US dollars, 
                        distributed between ADC I and ADC II. ADC I accepted submissions from January 2 to April 14, 2008. The 50 most promising entries, announced on May 12, 2008, 
                        each received a $25,000 award to further development. It ended in early September with the announcement of ten teams that received $275,000 each, 
                        and ten teams that received $100,000 each.

                        There is a community of open-source enthusiasts that build and share Android-based distributions (i.e. firmware) with a number of customizations and additional 
                        features, such as FLAC lossless audio support and the ability to store downloaded applications on the microSD card. This usually involves rooting the 
                        device. Rooting allows users root access to the operating system, enabling full control of the phone. Rooting has several disadvantages as well, including 
                        increased risk of hacking, high chances of bricking, losing warranty, increased virus attack risks, etc. It is also possible to install custom firmware, 
                        although the device's boot loader must also be unlocked. Custom firmware allows users of older phones to use applications available only on newer releases.

                        Those firmware packages are updated frequently, incorporate elements of Android functionality that haven't yet been officially released within a carrier-sanctioned firmware, 
                        and tend to have fewer limitations. CyanogenMod and OMFGB are examples of such firmware.

                        Obstacles to development include the fact that Android does not use established Java standards, that is, Java SE and ME. This prevents compatibility between 
                        Java applications written for those platforms and those written for the Android platform. Android reuses the Java language syntax and semantics, but it does not 
                        provide the full class libraries and APIs bundled with Java SE or ME. However, there are multiple tools in the market from companies such as Myriad Group and 
                        UpOnTek that provide Java ME to Android conversion services.

                        Android was created by the Open Handset Alliance, which is led by Google. The early feedback on developing applications for the Android platform was mixed. Issues cited include bugs, lack of 
                        documentation, inadequate QA infrastructure, and no public issue-tracking system. (Google announced an issue tracker on January 18, 2008.) In December 2007, MergeLab mobile startup founder Adam 
                        MacBeth stated, "Functionality is not there, is poorly documented or just doesn't work... It's clearly not ready for prime time." Despite this, Android-targeted applications began to appear the 
                        week after the platform was announced. The first publicly available application was the Snake game.

                        Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android 
                        development. It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems or as a subscription-based service in 2020. It is a replacement for the Eclipse Android 
                        Development Tools (E-ADT) as the primary IDE for native Android application development.
