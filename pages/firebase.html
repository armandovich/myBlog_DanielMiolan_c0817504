                        Firebase evolved from Envolve, a prior startup founded by James Tamplin and Andrew Lee in 2011. Envolve provided developers an API that enables the integration of online chat functionality into 
                        their websites. After releasing the chat service, Tamplin and Lee found that it was being used to pass application data that were not chat messages. Developers were using Envolve to sync application 
                        data such as game state in real time across their users. Tamplin and Lee decided to separate the chat system and the real-time architecture that powered it. They founded Firebase as a separate 
                        company in 2011 and it launched to the public in April 2012.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        Firebase's first product was the Firebase Realtime Database, an API that synchronizes application data across iOS, Android, and Web devices, and stores it on Firebase's cloud. The product assists 
                        software developers in building real-time, collaborative applications.
                    </p>
                    </br></br>
                    <p> 
                        In May 2012, a month after the beta launch, Firebase raised $1.1 million in seed funding from venture capitalists Flybridge Capital Partners, Greylock Partners, Founder Collective, and New Enterprise Associates. In 
                        June 2013, the company further raised $5.6 million in Series A funding from Union Square Ventures and Flybridge Capital Partners.

                        Google Firebase offers many features that pitch it as the go-to backend development tool for web and mobile apps. It reduces development workload and time. And it's a perfect prototyping tool. Firebase is 
                        simple, lightweight, friendly, and industrially recognized.

                        Firebase concept is simple. When you build a client-side app with JavaScript or any of its frameworks, for instance, Google Firebase can turn this into a serverless app in no time. It also 
                        removes the need to manage databases yourself, as it does that for you.
                    </p>
                    </br></br>
                    <p> 
                        Therefore, implementing Firebase means plugging a ready-made backend into your client code to make it dynamic. Ultimately, it eliminates the need to write backend code from scratch and gives you 
                        a fully functional one instead. Security-wise, it also has explicitly built-in security rules that make it a trusted data and server handler. Plus, you get a protected backend when you use these rules.
                    </p>
                    </br></br>
                    <p> 
                        Indeed, Firebase is a less technical and time-saving alternative to writing full-fledged backend code for dynamic apps. You might also want to consider leveraging this tool if you eventually wish to 
                        host and manage your app in the cloud. Being serverless, Firebase removes the need to worry about the technicalities of cloud server configuration. As a Google Cloud service, it also gives you access 
                        to other Google products and features, like Google Drive and Sheets. For instance, you can import dummy data from Google Sheets and use it temporarily to serve your app.
