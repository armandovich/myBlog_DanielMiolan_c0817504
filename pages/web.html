                        A web developer is a programmer or a coder who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of World Wide Web applications using a clientâ€“server model. 
                        The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. 
                        A web developer may specialize in client-side applications (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end developer), or both (full-stack developer). A web content management system 
                        may be used to develop and maintain web applications.

                    <p> 
                        There are no formal educational or license requirements to become a web developer. However, many colleges and trade schools offer coursework in web development. There are also 
                        many tutorials and articles which teach web development, freely available on the web - for example, on Basic JavaScript.
                    </p>

                        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web 
                        page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
                    </p>

                        "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet 
                        and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how 
                        elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, 
                        which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version.
                    </p>
                    </br></br>
                    <p> 
                        From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations 
                        separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification.

                        Javascript is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic and interactive web content like applications and browsers. JavaScript is so popular that it's the most used programming 
                        language in the world, used as a client-side programming language by 97.0% of all websites.
