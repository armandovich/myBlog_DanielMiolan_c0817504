                        Technology is the continually developing result of accumulated knowledge and application in all techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in industrial 
                        production and scientific research. Technology is embedded in the operation of all machines, with or without detailed knowledge of their function, for the 
                        intended purpose of an organization. The technologies of society consist of what is known as systems. Systems apply the intended application of a technology's 
                        accumulated knowledge by obtaining an input, altering this input for the system's intended purpose through what is known as a process, and then producing an 
                        outcome that alters the ultimate intended purpose of the system. This is also known as a technology system or technological system.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        The earliest and simplest form of technology is the development of knowledge that leads to the application of basic tools towards an intended purpose. The 
                        prehistoric invention of shaped stone tools and the discovery of how to control fire and increased the sources of food that were available to human beings 
                        through the proper cooking procedures that eliminated almost all disease-causing pathogens in food sources. The event that occurred after, the Neolithic 
                        Revolution, extended the importance of this event and quadrupled the sustenance available from a usable territory through the development of farming 
                        technologies.
                    </p>
                    </br></br>
                    <p> 
                        The invention of the wheel led to the travelling technologies that helped humans not only further increase the yield of food production over a given period, 
                        but also travel between and across territories in less time, where information could be more easily exchanged between members of society. Not only did this 
                        circumstance result in an increased total of food production and increased information exchange over large territories, but also the increased production of 
                        raw materials, such as spinning thread or yarn, through the invention of the spinning wheel. Since these raw materials can be processed into paper, the 
                        opportunity to provide information to a larger population had also become available during this period in history.

                        While Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and have raised new questions in the ethics of technology, the advancement of technology 
                        itself has also led to the pursuit of new solutions for the previously discussed concerns of technological advancement. For example, upcoming technology 
                        involves renewable resources being used in transportation, allowing humans to travel in space, for technology itself to become more affordable and reliable, 
                        and for automation to help the lives of billions of people. As technology creates the necessary solutions to our concerns through intellectual discovery, 
                        society advances the importance and application of technology in the 21st century.
